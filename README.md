## Why Call It Quokka???

Just search for [Quokka](https://www.google.com/search?q=quokka) and it will become obvious. Partially inspired by the Go Gopher, but also because I wanted to be able to have an extension (*.qk*) that didn't conflict with anything else. I couldn't find an existing language of the same name, but let me know if there is one.
