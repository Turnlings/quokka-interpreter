# Quokka Interpreter

## Overview

An interpreter for a dynamically typed, object-oriented toy programming language.

For detailed documentation, see the [docs/](docs) folder.

- Conditionals
- While and For Loops
- Functions
- Classes and Objects

### Planned

## Syntax Highlighting

A separate VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting for Quokka files (`*.qk`).  
See the [Quokka Extension repository](https://github.com/Turnlings/quokka-extension) for installation instructions and screenshots.

## Why Call It Quokka???

Just search for [Quokka](https://www.google.com/search?q=quokka) and it will become obvious. Partially inspired by the Go Gopher, but also because I wanted to be able to have an extension (*.qk*) that didn't conflict with anything else. I couldn't find an existing language of the same name, but let me know if there is one.
