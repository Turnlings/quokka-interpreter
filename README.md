# Quokka Interpreter

## Overview

A simple interpreter for a toy programming language supporting basic operations.  
This project so far includes a lexer and parser, along with a basic C transpiler for debugging.

For detailed documentation, see the [docs/](docs) folder.

## Motivation

This project was created to explore the design and implementation of interpreters and to deepen my understanding of the C programming language.
